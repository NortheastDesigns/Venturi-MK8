1.06 fileset coincides with the release of the second batch of side panels. ALL PARTS REMAIN CROSS COMPATIBLE, but I will list the changes made to the hardware below.

-”Venturi” logo changed from a cutout to a laser etched pattern, including a small NED Logo and TFA Logo.
-Powder coated panels listed as an option, the color options being Purple, Gold, Red, and Blue.
-Catch Plate & Catch Washer switched from Aluminum to Steel, to greatly reduce friction and improve trigger feel.

PARTS UPDATED: Updated: Catch House, Catch Roof, Trigger, Muzzle.

PARTS ADDED: Muzzle Nut Shims, M4 Panel Washer, M3 Panel Washer.

-Catch guides in the Catch House altered slightly.
-Catch Roof altered for less play in the catch plate to improve trigger pull.
-Trigger altered to be slimmer and easier to reach from the handle
-Dual sling mounting points added to the muzzle
-"Muzzle Nut Shims" added. Print two of these, and install them in the muzzle to keep the M4 nuts from falling out.
-M3 & M4 Panel Washers added. Use these underneath all screws that attach the side panels, to protect the powdercoated surface. They screw on fairly tight and will remain captive. 
For one Venturi you will need: 14x M4 Panel Washers, and 2x M3 Panel Washers.

-Butt Plate Carbine altered to improve sight picture and reduce print time
-Carbine Finish Plate 1 altered to reduce amount of support material needed
-Carbine Finish Plate 2 altered to prevent interference with Butt Plate
-Optional M4 Threaded sling mount points added to Butt Plate Carbine
-T Pull altered to improve aesthetics and ease install
-Pusher altered to fit tighter on the priming bars and improve strength of return spring mounts
-Pusher altered to better seal in the new turnaround
-Dart Tooth altered to slightly improve strength
-Pusher Top shortened slightly to prevent possible misfeeding

1.04 5/18/2021
PARTS UPDATED: Turnaround, PT Mount, Release external, Release internal, Butt Plate Carbine, AT T Gaurd, ST T Gaurd, Catch Surface, Dummy Cap, Pusher, Dart Tooth, All handles (MINOR)

PARTS ADDED: Turnaround (DO NOT PRINT UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!!!!!!!!!!!!)

-Turnaround updated to reduce print time and improve barrel mount seal (If you have the OLD Turnaround, you must print the "PT Mount OLD", found in the Extras and Experimental folder.)
-PT mount updated to fit updated turnaround. Old turnarounds must use the "PT Mount OLD", found in the Extras and Experimental folder.
-Release external diameter reduced slightly to ensure it doesn't rub against the handle
-Release internal changed to better hold spring
-Hex key slots altered in the butt plate to better hold the keys
-AT T Gaured altered so it no longer interferes with its handle mount
-ST T Gaured altered so it no longer interferes with its handle mount
-Release Internal altered to better contain the larger spring
-Catch surface altered slightly to improve smoothness of the prime and prevent possible stuckage on the dart roof
-Dummy Cap made slightly smaller to ease install, may require CA glue if your printer is very good.
-Pusher altered to ease T Pull install
-Pusher and Dart Tooth altered to allow the use of partially threaded M5x55mm screws. Old fully threaded screws will still work.

1.03 5/7/2021:
PARTS UPDATED: Monogrip, Dart Tooth, Pusher, Muzzle, Release Nub

PARTS ADDED: Butt Plate Carbine, Pivot Bushing Carbine, Finish Plate 1 Carbine, Finish Plate 2 Carbine

-Carbine parts added
-Monogrip mounting points changed to strengthen them
-Monogrip curvature altered slightly for better ergo
-Dart Tooth lengthened to prevent possible collision with pusher at max draw (WARNING: NEW DART TOOTH REQUIRES NEW PUSHER PRINT)
-Cutout added to the pusher to allow the lengthened dart tooth to seat when the action is in battery
-Muzzle SCAR Barrel cutout altered to thicken walls and improve print quality
-Release Nub changed so it clears the folding stock. The original long nub can be found in the extras folder, but it will not work with the carbine stock.

Minor changes:

All Handle Halves and the Trigger have had their spring mount bosses enlarged slightly to allow the use of alternate larger compression springs that will be included in future Frame Kits. The previous smaller springs will still fit.

1.02 4/21/2021:
PARTS UPDATED: Muzzle, Plunger, Catch House, Catch Roof, Release Nub

PARTS ADDED: M5 Thumbscrew BUTTON HEAD

-Ridges added to wedge muzzle against the side panels
-Muzzle thumbscrew nut slots made larger to ease nut install
-Plunger updated to reduce catch engagement and improve trigger pull
-Catch House altered so the catch only rides on two outer rails instead of an entire flat surface, reducing friction. (CATCH HOUSE NOW REQUIRES SUPPORT MATERIAL, GENERATED ONLY FROM THE BED.)
-Catch roof updated to reduce catch engagement and improve trigger pull
-Release nub lengthened to ensure the mounting screw doesn't interfere with the handle

1.01 4/18/2021:

-Two duplicate L slides were accidentally included with one mislabeled, correct R side added
-L slide updated to fix potential nozzle snag causing missed steps
-Catch roof opening made slightly smaller to limit play in the plunger while catch is engaged, improving trigger pull
-Small ramp added to the Actuator to prevent collisions with the Catch Plate.
-Alternate Actuators with different offsets added if the standard one doesn't work
-Opening for the trigger bar in the trigger widened to allow further actuation
-Muzzle altered to fit the LONG DETENT PIN. If you have a SHORT DETENT PIN, print the alternate "SHORT PIN MUZZLE" found in Extras & Experimental.
