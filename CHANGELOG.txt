1.06 fileset coincides with the release of the second batch of side panels. ALL PARTS REMAIN CROSS COMPATIBLE, but I will list the changes made to the hardware below.

-Powder coated panels listed as an option, the color options being Purple, Gold, Red, and Blue.
-Catch Plate & Catch Washer switched from Aluminum to Steel, to greatly reduce friction and improve trigger feel.

PARTS ADDED: Muzzle Nut Shims, M4 Panel Washer, M3 Panel Washer.

For one Venturi you will need: 14x M4 Panel Washers, and 2x M3 Panel Washers.
